Key principles for a better user experience include:

Prioritizing the user: Navigation should be intuitive, often using recognizable patterns and icons. The experience should also be seamless for users who switch between mobile and desktop versions of a product.

Focusing on user goals: Mobile design should anticipate what a user wants to accomplish and make those tasks as easy as possible. This includes features like using a camera to input credit card information, which simplifies the process. Personalization is also key to guiding users to relevant content.

Effective onboarding: The complexity of the onboarding process should match the complexity of the app. Simple apps require minimal introduction, while more intricate ones, like financial services apps, need a more thorough guide.

Using familiar gestures: Designers should incorporate standard gestures like pinching to zoom and swiping, as these are intuitive to most users.

Optimizing mobile layout: Design elements should be large enough for fingertips to tap accurately, ideally 7-10mm. It is also important to consider the "thumb zone," the area of the screen easily reachable with the thumb when holding the phone with one hand.

Adopting a minimalist approach: To avoid a cluttered and overwhelming interface, designers should eliminate any non-essential elements. This includes using a clear typographic hierarchy and sufficient contrast to ensure readability in various lighting conditions.

Focusing on speed and feedback: Mobile apps and websites need to be fast, especially considering that users may have slower data connections. Providing feedback through animations, transitions, or tactile responses can improve the user experience by acknowledging their actions.

Minimizing data input: Requiring users to fill out extensive forms can lead to them abandoning the task. Simplifying forms and offering options like signing in with existing Google or Facebook accounts can improve conversion rates.
