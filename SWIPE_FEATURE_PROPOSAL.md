# 👆 Swipe Gestures Feature Proposal

## ✅ Why Add Swipe Gestures?

Swipe gestures for flashcards are an **excellent UX improvement** and industry standard. Here's why:

### **Benefits:**

1. **Intuitive**: Natural gesture everyone knows
2. **Faster**: Quicker than tapping buttons
3. **One-handed**: Can study while holding phone
4. **Engaging**: More interactive and fun
5. **Standard**: Used by Anki, Quizlet, Duolingo, etc.

## 🎯 Proposed Swipe Actions

### **During Study (Card Face Visible):**

**Swipe Right** → "Good" (most common action)
**Swipe Left** → "Again" (need to review)
**Swipe Up** → "Easy" (mastered)
**Swipe Down** → "Hard" (difficult)

### **Alternative Simple Version:**

**Swipe Right** → Next card (Good)
**Swipe Left** → Previous card / Again
**Tap** → Flip card

## 🛠️ Implementation

Would use **react-native-gesture-handler** (already included with Expo):

```typescript
import { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import Animated, { 
  useSharedValue, 
  useAnimatedStyle,
  withSpring 
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

### **Features:**

- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Visual feedback (card tilts/moves)
- ✅ Haptic feedback on swipe
- ✅ Configurable swipe threshold
- ✅ Can still use buttons
- ✅ Undo last swipe

## 📊 User Experience

### **Visual Feedback:**
- Card follows finger during swipe
- Color overlay indicates action (green = good, red = again)
- Card flies off screen when released
- Next card slides in smoothly

### **Accessibility:**
- Buttons still available
- Configurable sensitivity
- Can disable in settings
- Works with screen readers

## 🎨 Design Mockup

│   [CARD CONTENT]    │
│                     │
│   Swipe Right →     │  Green overlay = Good
│                     │
