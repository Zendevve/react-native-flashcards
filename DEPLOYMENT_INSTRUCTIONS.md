## 🎯 Next Steps to Deploy

You have **two options** to complete the deployment:

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended) ⚡

Since the automated push failed due to token permissions, deploy manually:

**Steps:**

1. **Push changes to GitHub manually:**
   ```bash
   # Your changes are already committed locally
   # You need to push them through GitHub Desktop or update your token
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Zendevve/react-native-flashcards/settings/pages
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Manually trigger deployment:**
   
   **Option A - Using GitHub Web Interface:**
   - Go to the Actions tab in your repository
   - Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
   
   **Option B - Push via GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Push the commit "Add GitHub Pages deployment with web demo using mock data"
   - The workflow will run automatically

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Monitor the Actions tab
   - Deployment takes ~2-3 minutes
   - Your app will be live at: `https://zendevve.github.io/react-native-flashcards/`

### Option 2: Update Git Token and Deploy 🔧

If you want to use command-line deployment:

**Steps:**

1. **Update your GitHub token with workflow scope:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token with `workflow` scope
   - Update your git credentials

2. **Push changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically deploy**
